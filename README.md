# Sleep vs LIfestyly Patters & Factors

**Overview**
Sleep plays a crucial role in our overall health and well-being, yet many individuals struggle with getting enough sleep. We analyze the intricate relationship between professions, stress levels, lifestyle factors, and sleep patterns to uncover key insights into the factors influencing sleep quality and duration. Data analysis of various professions is used to identify what is most likely to disrupt the sleeping experience disorders, the impact of sleep disorders on sleep duration and investigate how stress levels, profession, and lifestyle choices influence sleep patterns. This study aims to contribute valuable insights that can inform strategies for improving sleep health and overall well-being among individuals in various professions and lifestyle choices. This project was colaborated on with Shaina Joseph, Julia McKinnon, and Ernesto Garcia.
